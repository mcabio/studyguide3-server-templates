# request.form.get: is a dictionary provided by the Request object (request). 
# It is used to access data from different parts of an HTTP request:
# Used to access data submitted through an HTML form with the *POST* method.
# If you have an HTML form with input fields, the data entered into those fields will 
# be available in request.form. With request.args.get, it is used to 
# access data from the query string of a URL. It's typically associated 
# with data sent in the URL as parameters with the *GET* method.
# responsible for storing the value of the name variable in the Flask session. 
# In Flask, the session object is a dictionary-like object that you can use 
# to store data that will be available across requests for the same user. 
# The 'name' key was used here instead of username because the provided base.html code
# already had it as the key.
